# Board Version History

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Welcome to the MARVIN (RAIL DIN Ready Relay Driver Board). This board is purpose-built to address a common need in electronics projects: providing a reliable DC relay driver. Its primary goal is to enable low-voltage output controllers like Arduino and ESP microcontrollers to efficiently control higher DC voltage switch relays (5/12VDC).
