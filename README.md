## Overview

### MARVIN - 4-Channel DC Relay Driver Board with Voltage Jumper Settings

MARVIN is a specialized RAIL DIN board measuring 76mm x 86mm, featuring two screw holes with 25mm center-to-center distance, designed for 4-channel DC relay driving. Unlike standard relays, MARVIN facilitates the output of user-selected DC voltages (with jumper settings for 5VDC or 12VDC) to activate external DC relay switches.

The board includes input terminals—WJ124-3.81-5P-14-00A and Header-Female-2.54_1x5, DZ254R-11-05-63—connected to the microcontroller's output pins. Powered by an external 5VDC source, this relay driver offers a specialized solution for various electronics projects.

**Key Features:**
- 4-channel DC relay driver with jumper settings for 5VDC or 12VDC output.
- Input terminals connected to microcontroller output pins.
- Designed for activating external DC relay switches using user-selected DC voltages.
- Dimensions: 76mm x 86mm RAIL DIN board with screw holes for easy installation.
- Powered by an external 5VDC source.
